The idea is simple, I wanted to have a GUI for the tools i made with python, since command line stuff is very linear.

so i thought, okay im very comfortable with the html/javascript gui, lets use it as a gui, and then pass objects/forms/files/values to python.

I feel I've solved an annoying problem that bothered me for awhile with this simple method.

to use:
install flask, and flask-cors
run the flask app.py found in the backend directory
open index.html found in the frontend directory, and what you send from the frontend is recieved in the backend.
